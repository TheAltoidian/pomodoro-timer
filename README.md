# Pomodoro Timer
A timer built on the principles of the Pomodoro Technique of time mangement, where you work in 25 minute stretches with breaks between. To start, open main.py, and then hit the Start button. The app will tell you how much longer is left in each segment, and whether you're taking a break or working in the current segment. Press the Restart button to clear all progress so you can start over.
